# hello-world
hello. this is the first repository I created.

I am pretty much a newcomer in Github, my friend introduced me to this cool stuff early on.
I've been working in a telecom company for more than 7 years in Jakarta, and in the last 2 years I began to have interest in Cloud, and in the last couple months, K8S.

During my free time I'm a sports-holic, playing soccer or running with my friends in the weekend. Books, movies, or sketching are my other things to spend my free time with. Every once in a while I love to travel as well.

Learning is my code. Curiousity is my weapon. "And be the best version of yourself, every single day" is my value of life.

Looking forward to learn from you all, guys!

Cheers,

Aryo
